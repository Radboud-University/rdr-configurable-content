# Configurable content for the Donders Repository portal

This repository allows managing the snippets of text that appear on the web portal, specific controlled vocabularies, naming schemes and references to external resources that map terms and names onto meanings and definitions.

For more detail about managing the content within this repository please see the instructions for [content editors](content_editors.md) and for [content managers](content_managers.md).
