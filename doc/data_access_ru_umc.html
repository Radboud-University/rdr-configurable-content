Use your own username and password as a Radboud University or UMC employee to log into the Data Access application.

The username starts with the character u, s, e or z, followed by a number, and is appended with @ru.nl (for u-, s-, e-numbers) or @umcn.nl (for z-numbers).<br />
For example: u100000@ru.nl or z1000000@umcn.nl.
