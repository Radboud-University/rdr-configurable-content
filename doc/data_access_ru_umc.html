You can use your Radboud University or Radboudumc username and password to log into the Data Access application. Your username starts with a lowercase u, s, e or z, followed by a number, and is appended with @ru.nl (for u-, s-, e-numbers) or @umcn.nl (for z-numbers). For example: u123456@ru.nl or z123456@umcn.nl.
