Data Use Agreements
====================

To share data, analysis pipelines and/or software in a "data sharing collection", the collection manager needs to select a Data Use Agreement (DUA) and close the collection. Only published collections can be accessed by external users, and only after them explicitly agreeing with the DUA.

If you share data that was acquired at the Donders Institute in a researcher-initiated project, you can use the RU-DI specific agreement. You should use the RU-DI-HD agreement when the data is potentially identifiable, e.g. defaced anatomical MRIs. You can use the RU-DI-NH agreement when data is 100% anonymous and not identifiable. You should contact your datasteward and the RU legal department to make a tailored agreement in case the data that you are sharing contains potentially sensitive information, or in case the data has been acquired in an industry-sponsored project.

:dua:`RU-DI-NH-1.0` Radboud University - Donders Institute - Non-Human Data 1.0

If you share data that was acquired elsewhere, or if the data acquired at the Donders cannot be shared under one of the RU-DI agreements (e.g. because journal policies require a specific agreement), then you can use one of the `OpenDataCommons <https://opendatacommons.org>`_ or `Creative Commons <https://creativecommons.org>`_ licenses. See `here <https://creativecommons.org/choose/>`_ to help make a decision.

If you are only sharing source code of software, simulations or data analysis scripts and not data that originates from actual measurements, you should use a copyright agreement rather than a data use agreement.
