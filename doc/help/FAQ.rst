Edit collection metadata (for collection managers)
-----------
The data repository allows a researcher to archive digital data into **collections**. It contains separate collections for preservation, for research documentation and for sharing:

* In a **Data Acquisition Collection** (DAC), the data are archived in their original form. Here, original means without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data.
* A **Research Documentation Collection** (RDC) documents the process via which data are converted into published results.
* A **Data Sharing Collection** (DSC) contains the data that on which published results are based, allowing external researchers to extend scientific findings by reanalyzing data with new methods, and/or by addressing new research questions using these data.
