Share data with external reviewers 
==================================

1.  **How do I share data with external reviewers?**

    The Donders Repository includes the possibility of sharing data from a Data Sharing Collection with external reviewers (i.e. before publication) in a way that protects the anonymity of the reviewers. For details :ref:`see here <publish-dsc-share-data>`.

2.  **I received a "reviewer access URL". How should I use it?**

    The reviewer access URL is for review purposes only and leads to the collection page of a Data Sharing Collection that is not yet published. See :ref:`this page <reviewer-access>` for information on conditions of use and downloading data.
