<h1>Get started: deposit data</h1>
<ol class="arabic" id="faq-collection-types">
<li><p><strong>What are the different Collection types?</strong></p>
<p>There are three collection types, one for data acquisition (Data Acquisition Collection), one for research documentation (Research Documentation Collection) and one for data sharing (Data Sharing Collection).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Data Acquisition Collection (DAC).</strong> In a Data Acquisition Collection, the research data are archived in their original form. Here, &quot;original&quot; means without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data. To learn more about the files that you must upload to a Data Acquisition Collection, see <a class="reference internal" href="organise-data-collections.html#faq-dac-files"><span class="std std-ref">what to upload to a DAC</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Documentation Collection (RDC).</strong> When a paper is accepted for publication, the associated RDC must document the process via which data are converted into the to-be-published results. Prior to the paper being accepted for publication, the RDC can be used as a collaboration platform via which all kinds of files are shared (analysis scripts, preliminary figures, the different versions of the paper, ...). To learn more about the files that you must upload to a RDC, see <a class="reference internal" href="organise-data-collections.html#faq-rdc-files"><span class="std std-ref">what to upload to a RDC</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" id="faq-dsc">
<li><p><strong>Data Sharing Collection (DSC).</strong> A DSC contains the data on which the published results are based, allowing other researchers to extend scientific findings by re-analyzing data with new methods, and/or by addressing new research questions using these data. To learn more about the files that you must upload to a DSC, see <a class="reference internal" href="publish-data.html#faq-dsc-files"><span class="std std-ref">what to upload to a DSC</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" id="faq-how-to-request-collection" start="2">
<li><p><strong>How should I request a Data Acquisition Collection/Research Documentation Collection/ Data Sharing Collection (DAC/RDC/DSC)?</strong></p>
<p>New collections can only be requested by researchers working at or affiliated with the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior. The Donders Insitute has 4 organizational units, which all have their own management and implementation of RDM procedures: DCCN, DCC, DCN and DCMN. The way to request a collection differs per organizational unit. For details please check the Intranet of Donders Institute: <a class="reference external" href="https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/">https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What are research data?</strong></p>
<p>Research data are defined as follows:</p>
<p>All information that is (1) generated as a part of the research process and (2) on which a scientific report is/will be based.</p>
<p>This definition of research data does not only include empirical data, but also simulated data, computer scripts for analysis and simulations, stimuli presented in experiments and the computer scripts for presenting them, etc. A good way to determine what is the research data on which a study is based, is asking oneself what information has contributed to the results on which you report in your publication. And a good way to delineate the empirical from the other research data, is by asking oneself whether one has used some device for obtaining these data: empirical data are always collected using a device (a button box, a keyboard, an MRI scanner, an EEG or MEG system, a video camera, a touch screen, a microscope, ...).</p>
<p>Not all studies and publications depend on research data, as defined above. This holds for theoretical, perspective and opinion papers, as well as for reviews. The Donders Repository is only relevant for those studies and publications that do depend on research data.</p>
