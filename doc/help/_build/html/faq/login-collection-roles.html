<ol class="arabic" id="faq-surfconext">
<li><p><strong>What is SURFconext?</strong></p>
<p>SURFconext allows all academic institutes and schools in The Netherlands to use a single login. SURFconext allows you to access online services with the username and password issued by your own institution.</p>
<p>In SURFconext your personal details are only provided to a service provider (such as the Donders Repository) if these details are needed to use the service.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>In my browser I cannot select any institution. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>The dialog box to select your institution can be used in most popular browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Other browsers may not be supported. Your browser must support the use of cookies and JavaScript.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" id="faq-surfconext-add-institute" start="3">
<li><p><strong>What if my institute is not listed in the login window?</strong></p>
<p>If your institute is not listed when you try to log in, you should contact the person who is responsible for SURFconext at your institution and ask for your institute to be allowed to access the Donders Repository. You can contact SURFconext (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;surfconext&#46;nl">support<span>&#64;</span>surfconext<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>) to find out who is responsible at your institution. When contacting SURFconext, you can use this template email:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Dear SURFconext support team,

I am employed by [the name of your university/institute] and would like to get access to the Donders Repository, a service to which I can get access via SURFconext. Could you give me the contact details of the SURFconext person of my organization?

In case your institute does not use SURFconext, you can use any of your social accounts (Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, MicroSoft) via the Onegini option to log in. With a social account the access to data is limited to published Data Sharing Collections. You cannot be added to Data Acquisition Collections or Research Documentation Collections with a social account.

For further questions on authenticating yourself, contact datasupport@donders.ru.nl.

<ol class="arabic" id="faq-orcid" start="4">
<li><p><strong>What is an ORCID-iD?</strong></p>
<p>ORCID provides you with a unique individual and persistent digital identifier that enables you to connect research contributions and to share information on large scale with other researchers. You can login to the Donders Repository using your ORCID-iD. Read how to create and ORCID-iD on the webpage (<a class="reference external" href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a>). Note that you must set your ORCID account <strong>e-mail settings</strong> such that your e-mail address is shared with at least trusted parties (such as the Donders Repository). This is required to verify your identity on the background. See also <a class="reference internal" href="access-shared-data.html#faq-orcid-permissions"><span class="std std-ref">this FAQ</span></a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" id="faq-onegini" start="5">
<li><p><strong>What is an Onegini account?</strong></p>
<p>Onegini allows you to create a digital identity that can be used to access repository. You can use Google+, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft account to login to the Donders Repository via Onegini. Read how to create an Onegini account on the Onegini webpage (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.onegini.com/">https://www.onegini.com/</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" id="faq-multiple-user-profiles" start="6">
<li><p><strong>Can I have multiple user profiles in the repository?</strong></p>
<p>One person can have multiple user profiles in the repository, e.g. if that person has an account at multiple universities, or if that person uses both his academic account and his social account. If you log in to the Donders Repository with different accounts, your profiles are likely to have access to different collections in different roles. Different accounts from the same user cannot be linked.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" id="faq-differences-between-roles" start="7">
<li><p><strong>What are the differences between the roles in a collection?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <strong>viewer</strong> can view the collection details and content and can download files.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>contributor</strong> can add, modify and delete files in the collection and can update the collection details (title, abstract, keywords, etc.). Furthermore, a contributor has all the rights that a viewer has.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>manager</strong> can add and remove users to the collection, including other managers, and can change the role of other users. A manager can also irreversibly archive a collection. Furthermore, a manager has all the rights that a viewer and a contributor have.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Carefully consider it if you want to add someone else as a manager to the collection. The managers jointly share the responsibility for the collection. One manager can remove another manager from the collection. You should only make someone manager if you believe that this person would make the same decisions that you would make yourself, and would consult you in case of doubt.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" id="faq-who-can-be-assigned-to-roles" start="8">
<li><p><strong>Who can be assigned to the different roles?</strong></p>
<p>To be assigned for all roles the user must have an authenticated account (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/surfconext/index.html">SURFconext</a>). Users with an ORCID-iD cannot be assigned as manager. Users with a social account cannot be assigned as a manager or a contributor.</p>
<p>To be assigned as a manager the user has to be added to one of the participating organizational units (DCC, DCCN, DCMN, DCN) by that unit's research administrator. In this way, it is ensured that only the members of an organizational unit can be assigned the responsibility that comes with the manager role.</p>
