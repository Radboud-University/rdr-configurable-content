<span id="publish-dsc-share-data"></span><h1>Publish DSC and share data</h1>
<p>To share your research data with researchers other than your collaborators you can use a <a class="reference internal" href="../../faq/deposit-data.html#faq-collection-types"><span class="std std-ref">Data Sharing Collection</span></a> (DSC) (see this FAQ: <a class="reference internal" href="../../faq/publish-data.html#faq-dsc-files"><span class="std std-ref">Which files should and should I not upload to a DSC?</span></a>.</p>
<p>A DSC should be published together with the publication of the manuscript. Similar to the publication process in scientific journals, the DSC can follow an internal and external review process before being published.</p>
<div class="note alert alert-info admonition" id="dr-note-0">
<p class="admonition-title">INFO</p>
<p>Please note that only the manager of a collection can publish a collection.</p>
</div>
<p>By publishing a DSC, your research data are made publicly available. If you do not want to share your data immediately (e.g. if you are still working on follow up publications based on the same data), you should share the data under an embargo period of a certain time. In the embargo period the published DSC is visible on the web portal with a subset of the collection details. However, the access to its data content will not be publicly available. The embargo period can only be set by the research administrator. Therefore, when requesting a DSC <a class="reference internal" href="../../faq/deposit-data.html#faq-how-to-request-collection"><span class="std std-ref">(see this FAQ)</span></a> make sure you specify the embargo period.</p>
<p>When publishing the DSC, you also need to select your &quot;data use agreement&quot; <a class="reference internal" href="../../faq/publish-data.html#faq-data-use-agreement"><span class="std std-ref">(see this FAQ)</span></a></p>
<p>To publish a DSC, you must initially follow the same internal review procedure as described for archiving a <a class="reference internal" href="archive-dac-rdc.html#archive-dac-rdc"><span class="std std-ref">Data Acquisition Collection (DAC) or a Research Documentation Collection (RDC)</span></a>.</p>
<div class="note alert alert-info admonition" id="dr-note-1">
<p class="admonition-title">INFO</p>
<p>Note that a (reserved) <a class="reference internal" href="../../faq/publish-data.html#faq-persistent-identifier-dr"><span class="std std-ref">persistent identifier</span></a> is assigned to a DSC immediately after the colleciton is created. If required, you can already add this persistent identifier to your manuscript; however, only after <em>publishing</em> the collection, the persistent identifier becomes active and will point to the published DSC.</p>
</div>
<p>If all collaborators agree on the content of the collection, you may want or be requested to allow external reviewers to access your DSC before publishing it.</p>
<p>When the status of the current DSC is &quot;reviewable internal&quot;, you can change its status to &quot;reviewable external&quot; by clicking the button and confirming the state change. In this state, the collection is still read-only.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/switch_to_reviewable_external.jpg" src="../../_images/switch_to_reviewable_external.jpg" />
</div>
<p>A collection-specific URL is available specifically for external reviewers to access your collection. This URL should only be shared with the editor of the journal to which you send your manuscript. You can retrieve the URL by clicking the &quot;get reviewer access URL&quot; button. Any reviewer that uses the link is added to the DSC having the same rights a viewer has.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/get_reviewer_access_url.jpg" src="../../_images/get_reviewer_access_url.jpg" />
</div>
<p>When sharing the URL with the journal editor, make sure to include a small explanation about how to access the repository and download data. Here's a template e-mail that you can use for that:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">reviewable</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">paper</span> <span class="n">XXX</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">YYY</span> <span class="n">can</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">found</span> <span class="n">via</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">following</span> <span class="n">URL</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">donders</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ru</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">nl</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">login</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">reviewer</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">CollectionSpecificURL</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">replace</span> <span class="n">CollectionSpecificURL</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">you</span> <span class="n">copy</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">paste</span> <span class="n">when</span> <span class="n">clicking</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="s2">&quot;get reviewer access&quot;</span> <span class="n">button</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">URL</span> <span class="n">provided</span> <span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">only</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">shared</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">reviewers</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="n">will</span> <span class="n">only</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">publicly</span> <span class="n">available</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="n">manuscript</span> <span class="n">acceptance</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">which</span> <span class="n">case</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">persistent</span> <span class="n">identifier</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">currently</span> <span class="n">reserved</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="n">collection</span> <span class="n">will</span> <span class="n">become</span> <span class="n">effective</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By following the URL, reviewers can view the data sharing collection in their web-browser and can download the collection content according to the instructions found at <a class="reference internal" href="../access-shared-data.html#access-shared-data"><span class="std std-ref">access shared data</span></a>.</p>
<p>After external review, the DSC may require changes. This can be done by making the DSC editable again (click button &quot;switch to editable&quot;). The internal and external review process for the data publication can be repeated if required.</p>
<p>When the manuscript is accepted for publication, the Data Sharing Collection should be published by changing its state from &quot;reviewable external&quot; to &quot;published&quot; by clicking the &quot;switch to published&quot; button.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/switch_to_published.jpg" src="../../_images/switch_to_published.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="note alert alert-info admonition" id="dr-note-2">
<p class="admonition-title">INFO</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this step is irreversible! See below for information about re-opening a published collection. Note that the <em>actual</em> publication process takes some time (e.g., several minutes or hours), depending on the size of the data collection.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/collection_being_published.png" src="../../_images/collection_being_published.png" />
</div>
<p>After the collection is published a permanent read-only copy of the collection will be created and the <a class="reference internal" href="../../faq/publish-data.html#faq-persistent-identifier-dr"><span class="std std-ref">persistent identifier</span></a> that was assigned will become active. The persistent identifier can be used for future references.</p>
<p>A few details of a DSC can still be changed - using the &quot;edit metadata&quot; button - after it has been published, e.g., linking publications to it, and changing its collection users.</p>
<p>After the collection is published, a version number (1) is assigned.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/metadata_published_collection.jpg" src="../../_images/metadata_published_collection.jpg" />
</div>
<p>In case you discover mistakes in your collection content, it is possible to re-open a collection. However, be aware that it is not preferred, as creating a second version of the collection will use double the amount of storage space.</p>
<div class="note alert alert-info admonition" id="dr-note-3">
<p class="admonition-title">INFO</p>
<p>As indicated when clicking the &quot;switch to editable&quot; button, you must contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:datasupport&#37;&#52;&#48;donders&#46;ru&#46;nl">datasupport<span>&#64;</span>donders<span>&#46;</span>ru<span>&#46;</span>nl</a> to ask the system administrator to reopen the collection.</p>
</div>
<p>After the collection has been reopend by the system administrator, an &quot;editable&quot; <em>draft version</em> is created. You can edit the collection content in the same way as before publishing it. You can still view the details of &quot;Version 1&quot;, but these are no longer editable and you cannot edit its content.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/reopend_dsc_draft.jpg" src="../../_images/reopend_dsc_draft.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Once you have updated the <em>draft</em> version of your collection, you should follow the same procedure for publishing the collection again, as described before on this page.</p>
<p>After publishing this collection, a new version number (2) is assigned.</p>
