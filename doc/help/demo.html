<h1>DR help document demo page</h1>
<p>Research Data Management (RDM) aims to improve the research <strong>efficiency and transparency</strong>, and to fulfill the <strong>requirements</strong> of the university, funders, and legislation. The Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour (DI) uses a Data Repository (DR) for data management. The repository serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data preservation</strong> for internal reuse</li>
<li><strong>Research documentation</strong> for increasing reusability and reproducibility</li>
<li><strong>Data sharing</strong> with the external scientific community</li>
</ol>
<h1>FAQs</h1>
<h2><a name="faq1"></a>1. Why do I need to login / create an account to download published data?</h2>
<p>The majority of data sets shared through the Donders Repository include data collected in human subjects. If the data is potentially identifiable - e.g. MRI data - these data are shared with restrictions to ensure the privacy of research participants. In line with privacy legislation, the Radboud University (security officer) and local ethical committee require that users of these data publications can be identified (e.g. in case of violation of a Data Use Agreement). Therefore, authentication in the Donders Repository is required to download these data sets.</p>
<p><em>Downloading completely anonymized datasets and non-human / non-sensitive datasets published under an OpenDataCommons or CreativeCommons license, preferably does not require authentication. Developments to allow anonymous access to these data publications are currently ongoing. (Expected release: January 2019).<br /></em></p>
