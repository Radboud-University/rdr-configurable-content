<p><strong>1. What is SURFconext?</strong></p>
<p>SURFconext allows all academic institutes and schools in The Netherlands to use a single login. SURFconext allows you to access online services with the username and password issued by your own institution.</p>
<p>In SURFconext your personal details are only provided to a service provider (such as the Donders Repository) if these details are needed to use the service.</p>
<p><strong>2. In my browser I cannot select any institution. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>The dialog box to select your institution can be used in most popular browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Other browsers may not be supported. Your browser must support the use of cookies and JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>3. What if my institute is not listed in the login window?</strong></p>
<p>If your institute is not listed when you try to log in, you should contact the person who is responsible for SURFconext at your institution and ask for your institute to be allowed to access the Donders Repository. You can contact SURFconext (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;surfconext&#46;nl">support<span>&#64;</span>surfconext<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>) to find out who is responsible at your institution. When contacting SURFconext, you can use this template email:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Dear SURFconext support team,</em></p>
<p><em>I am employed by [the name of your university/institute] and would like to get access to the Donders Repository, a service to which I can get access via SURFconext. Could you give me the contact details of the SURFconext person of my organization?</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In case your institute does not use SURFconext, you can use any of your social accounts (Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, MicroSoft) via the Onegini option to log in. With a social account the access to data is limited to published Data Sharing Collections. You cannot be added to Data Acquisition Collections or Research Documentation Collections with a social account.</p>
<p>For further questions on authenticating yourself, contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:datasupport&#37;&#52;&#48;donders&#46;ru&#46;nl">datasupport<span>&#64;</span>donders<span>&#46;</span>ru<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is an ORCID-iD?</strong></p>
<p>ORCID provides you with a unique individual and persistent digital identifier that enables you to connect research contributions and to share information on large scale with other researchers. You can login to the Donders Repository using your ORCID-iD. Read how to create and ORCID-iD on the webpage (<a class="reference external" href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a>). Note that you must set your ORCID account <strong>e-mail settings</strong> such that your e-mail address is shared with at least trusted parties (such as the Donders Repository). This is required to verify your identity on the background.</p>
<p><strong>5. What is an Onegini account?</strong></p>
<p>Onegini allows you to create a digital identity that can be used to access repository. You can use Google+, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft account to login to the Donders Repository via Onegini. Read how to create an Onegini account on the Onegini webpage (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.onegini.com/">https://www.onegini.com/</a>).</p>
<p><strong>6. Can I have multiple user profiles in the repository?</strong></p>
<p>One person can have multiple user profiles in the repository, e.g. if that person has an account at multiple universities, or if that person uses both his academic account and his social account. If you log in to the Donders Repository with different accounts, your profiles are likely to have access to different collections in different roles. Different accounts from the same user cannot be linked.</p>

<h2>Organize data collections<a class="headerlink" href="#organize-data-collections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Which files should and should I not upload to a Data Acquisition Collection (DAC)?</strong></p>
<p>A DAC must contain all raw data plus a description that would allow a colleague to make sense of the .</p>
<p>By raw, we mean without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data. In other words, raw data are original data.</p>
<p>Some examples for the different methods:
<em>Behavioral experiments</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div>stimulus files
computer scripts for presenting the stimuli (to be run by Presentation or PsychoPy)
experiment log files</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Anatomical MRI experiments</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div>DICOM files</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Functional MRI experiments</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div>DICOM files
possibly eye tracker data
possibly video files
possibly ExG files
(if applicable) the files specified under “behavioral experiments”</div></blockquote>
<p><em>EEG experiments</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div>EEG files (vhdr/vmrk/dat)
Presentation log files
possibly eye tracker data
possibly video and audio files that were recorded along with the EEG
(if applicable) the files specified under “behavioral experiments”</div></blockquote>
<p><em>MEG experiments</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div>MEG datasets
Presentation log files
possibly eye tracker data that was recorded along
possibly video and audio files that were recorded along with the EEG
(if applicable) the files specified under “behavioral experiments”</div></blockquote>
<p>In general, you should also upload a copy of the Presentation code and stimulus material that you used during the experiment and of the lab notes that you took during the experiment. Also include a description of the experimental setup.</p>
<p>You should not upload personal information to a DAC (or any other collection). Personal information are data that directly identify your subjects (e.g., their name, address, telephone number, bank account, etc.). This also means that you should not upload the informed consent form that is signed by the subject. Note that the DAC is allowed to contain indirectly identifying information, such as detailed questionnaire results (but with the personal information removed), photos, audio and video recordings or facial features in an anatomical MRI.</p>
<p>You should not upload any data that can be obtained as the result of analyses that take raw data as input (processed data). Documenting the data analysis is a part of the Research Documentation Collection (RDC).</p>
<p><strong>2. How should I organize the data in a Data Acquisition Collection (DAC)?</strong></p>
<p>Organize your DAC in a standard way (such as BIDS), because will make it much easier to share the data at a later point in time. Below is one example from the BIDS website. See for more examples here.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/BIDS.PNG"><img alt="_images/BIDS.PNG" src="_images/BIDS.PNG" style="width: 683.5px; height: 314.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>For all types of data we recommend that you add a ‘readme’ document that describes the organization of the data over the files and directories.</p>
<p>For an example of a well-organized DAC from a DCCN project see here (pdf, 75 kB). The first page of this document contains the content of the ‘readme_general’ file, including the DAC abstract.</p>
<p><strong>3. Which files should and should I not upload to a Research Documentation Collection (RDC)?</strong></p>
<p>An RDC has three functions: documenting the scientific process, sharing preliminary results within the project team, and documenting the editorial and peer-review process:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>In general, a RDC must contain all the information that a knowledgeable colleague needs to reproduce the results in the publication that is linked to this collection. More specifically, an RDC should contain files that document the process in which raw data are converted into results (statistical tests, summary measures, figures, tables, etc.). In a common scenario, this conversion from raw data to results is (partially or fully) specified by analysis scripts that can be executed by software packages such as MATLAB, R, Python, SPSS, Bash+FSL, etc. In this scenario, the obvious way of documenting the scientific process is by providing these analysis scripts. Also the version number of the software being use should be specified.</div></blockquote>
<p>Our definition of “data” is a broad one. For instance, it also includes computer scripts, as used for analysis or modeling work. Thus, if the published results depend on computer scripts, these must be added to the RDC.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A RDC is a platform for sharing preliminary results (figures, tables, PowerPoint presentations, etc.) with collaborators in a project team. A RDC should contain the documents of the editorial and peer-review process pertaining to the publication that is linked to this collection (uploaded manuscripts, reviews, reply to the reviewers, …). An archived RDC must be linked to one publication.</div></blockquote>
<p>Also include a description of the experimental setup.</p>
<p>Before closing the RDC, the preliminary results may be removed.</p>
<p><strong>4. How to refer to the data that the researcher did not collect?</strong></p>
<p>It is possible to publish papers without having collected data yourself. For example, modeling work or using an existing data set. There are three ways to link these types of data to the new RDC.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If the data is already represented in the repository as one or more DAC’s, specify the DAC identification numbers in the RDC. This only works for archived DACs. A single archived DAC may be associated with multiple RDCs.
If the data is not represented in the repository, the researchers must either add the data to the repository, or document the data by a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI or URL). This situation applies when a DAC is not yet archived or the data was collected at another institute.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>5. How should I organize the data in a Research Documentation Collection (RDC)?</strong></p>
<p>Data in a RDC should be organized in separate folders and sub-folders according to the type of data (e.g. raw data, scripts, peer-review process, etc.). The names of the folders should clearly indicate to the content of the folder.</p>
<p><strong>6. How should I document the experimental setup?</strong></p>
<p>You must describe your experiment in a document (txt, csv, tsv, pdf, MS Word or MS Excel) that you upload to the collection. In this document, give a brief description of your experimental setup, which tasks you used and what they attend to manipulate and measure. In that document, you also explain how the conditions, stimuli and responses are represented in the presentation log files and the trigger channel of your data acquisition system. A PowerPoint presentation of the project proposal will contribute to the documentation of the experiment. Also the original presentation code (NBS Presentation, E-Prime, etc.) will contribute to the documentation. Add relevant part of this information to the appropriate collection (DAC, RDC and DSC).</p>
<p><strong>7. Where should I store personal information about the participants?</strong></p>
<p>For data acquisition you have to know who are your participants and you need to be able to contact them. This requires personal information to be stored. The mapping of the personal information on the participant number is called the “pseudonimization key”. The pseudonimization key should be stored in an encrypted file that is stored separately from the experimental data. The file should be protected by a strong password according to the RU password policy. The password is only to be known to the PI and the researchers involved in data acquisition.</p>
<p>The pseudonimization key must never be stored in the repository.</p>

<p><strong>1. Should I always share the data of my publication?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Our funding agencies, such as NWO and EU, require this either explicitly in the grant on basis of which you carried out the work, or implicitly in their general regulations. The Radboud University has made open access part of its policy. The Donders Institute requires sharing the data.</p>
<p>There might be reasons why you do not want to share your data immediately, e.g. if you are still working on follow up publications based on the same data. In those cases you should share the data under an embargo of a certain time.</p>
<p>There might be reasons why you do not want to share your data with everyone, e.g. if it represents financial value. In those cases you should make a custom data use agreement under which the data is to be shared (which might e.g. contain a clause about paying for the data).</p>
<p>There might be reasons related to the privacy of your subjects and where the data cannot be de-identified. In that case you still might be able to share processed results at the group level that allow other researchers to validate the claims in your paper. Note that unprocessed imaging and MEG/EEG data can be shared after it has been de-identified and under the appropriate data use agreement.</p>
<p><strong>2. Can I share my data if they belong to an ongoing project?</strong></p>
<p>When a research project is still ongoing (i.e. the Data Acquisition Collection is still open), and the researchers want to write a paper using the data collected until present, then they can create a Data Sharing Collection (DSC) in which the data that were used in the publication are shared. You should document in the DSC that these shared data are part of a larger project, of which only a part is shared in the current DSC.</p>
<p><strong>3. What data should I share in a Data Sharing Collection (DSC)?</strong></p>
<p>You should share all data that is of potential value to other researchers: the DSC should contain the relevant information (1) to reproduce the published results, and (2) to extend on these published results.</p>
<p>However, you should only share data that has been de-identified and that cannot be traced back to the individual. Keep in mind that, in all cases, sharing human data requires that the participants have signed an informed consent form that allows the data to be shared.</p>
<p>Raw photos, videos or audio files should not be shared in a DSC.</p>
<p><strong>4. How should I organize the data in the repository (DAC/RDC/DSC)?</strong></p>
<p>Organize your collections in a standard way (such as BIDS), because will make it much easier to share the data at a later point in time. Below is one example from the BIDS website. See more examples here.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/BIDS.PNG"><img alt="_images/BIDS.PNG" src="_images/BIDS.PNG" style="width: 683.5px; height: 314.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>For all types of data we recommend that you add a text document (txt, pdf or Microsoft Word) that describes the organization of the data over the files and directories.</p>
<p><strong>5. What is a Data Use Agreement (DUA)?</strong></p>
<p>The DUA specifies the conditions under which data in a DSC is shared, e.g. to give attribution. The DUA may also include details on specific limitations on the reuse of the data. As manager or contributor to the DSC you specify under which DUA the data is to be shared. When the external researcher agrees with the collection’s DUA, he/she will be automatically added as a viewer to it, which gives him/her read access.</p>
<p>The repository provides two default DUAs: for collections that include potentially identifiable data from individual human subjects, please use RU-DI-HD-1.0; for collections that only include data that cannot be identified in any way (e.g. only group results, or data that does not originate from human subjects), please use RU-DI-NH-1.0. We also support several others DUAs for other types of data. If a dataset has more specific requirements for data sharing (e.g. due to sensitivity of data or requirements of funders or collaborating partners), it is required to make a custom DUA. See here a list of aspects to consider in the design of a DUA. For further help, please send an email to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:datasupport&#37;&#52;&#48;donders&#46;ru&#46;nl">datasupport<span>&#64;</span>donders<span>&#46;</span>ru<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. What is a persistent identifier?</strong></p>
<p>A persistent identifier is a long-lasting reference to an online document or file. The Donders Repository persistent identifiers are realized by the handle system. See more on the Wikipedia page: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier</a></p>
<p><strong>7. Can I use the persistent identifiers generated by the Donders Repository for my publication?</strong></p>
<p>As a prerequisite for publication, several journals now request a persistent identifier of the shared data, which they publish in the footnote of the article. Researchers from the Donders Institute can use the persistent identifier of the published Data Sharing Collection (DSC) for that purpose.</p>
<p>A published DSC’s persistent identifier has the same status as the persistent identifiers that are typically used to refer to published journal articles, such as the digital object identifiers (DOIs). A persistent identifier allows for direct access to a digital object, even if its URL has changed.</p>
<p>When sending the DSC’s persistent identifier to the journal, in the email, you should add some additional information pertaining to the conditions under which the shared data can be accessed. Here is a template email that you can use for that purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>“The shared data for paper XXX-YYY can be found via the following persistent identifier: http://hdl.handle.net/MyPersistentID (replace MyPersistentID by the string that you copy and paste from the collection details page).</em></p>
<p><em>Prior to accessing and downloading the shared data, users must create an account. It is possible to use an institutional account, an ORCID account, or a social ID from Google+, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Microsoft. After authentication, users must accept the Data Use Agreement (DUA), after which they are automatically authorised to download the shared data. The DUA specifies whether there are any restrictions on how the data may be used.</em></p>
<p><em>As an example of how to access shared data, one may follow the Digital Object Indentifier (doi) in the data availability segment of the footnote of this paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154881. Instructions for how to request access and to download shared data can be found at http://www.ru.nl/donders/research/data/user-manual/access-shared-data/.</em></p>
<p><em>The Radboud University and the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour will keep these shared data available for at least 10 years.”</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>8. Can I share my data without the need for the downloading user to register an account?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, this is not possible. The reason is that most DSCs have restrictions on the  reuse of the data, e.g. the requirement to cite Radboud University as the source of the data and to protect the identity of human participants. Agreeing with a DUA is only possible for registered users.</p>
<p>Journals usually accept that data sets are shared only after registering / access request, if data sets include potentially identifiable human data (e.g. MRI). In this case, you should explain to the journal why access request, and logging in to the repository, is required to access the data. Here’s a template paragraph that you can use for this purpose:</p>
<p>“All data was acquired in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, following informed consent of participants and in line with the requirements of the Ethics Committee. In line with requirements of the Ethics Committee and the Radboud University security officer, potentially identifying data (such as imaging data) can only be shared to identifable researchers, hence the requirement for registration and for requesting access. Neither authors nor data steward is involved in granting access to external researchers, this is only based on the complete registration of the researcher and follows a “click-through” procedure. We believe that this procedure is in line with your policy, while at the same time being as open and transparent as possible.”</p>
<p><strong>9. What if a ‘published’ Data Sharing Collection (DSC) contains incorrect information?</strong></p>
<p>If a ‘published’ DSC contains incorrect and/or insufficient information, a collection manager may ask the research administrator to make it ‘editable’ again, allowing for changes to be made. If this DSC is modified and thereafter changed to ‘published’ again, then a second read-only copy is generated, with another unique persistent identifier.</p>
<p>Since the original collection is persistent, it will remain accessible as well. Therefore, carefully check all the files before changing a DSC to ‘published’.</p>
<p><strong>10. How many publications can be linked to a Data Sharing Collection (DSC)?</strong></p>
<p>A DSC can be linked to zero, one or multiple publications. The first situation (no publication) occurs when a data set is considered useful for external researchers in their future studies. The second situation (one publication) typically occurs when a data set is used in a publication, and the DSC is shared around the same time that the paper becomes available on the publisher’s website. The third situation (more publications) typically occurs when a DSC gets reused in other publications following the paper that was published together with DSC.</p>
