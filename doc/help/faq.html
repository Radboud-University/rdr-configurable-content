<li><p class="first"><strong>What is SURFconext?</strong></p>
<p>SURFconext allows all academic institutes and schools in The Netherlands to use a single login. SURFconext allows you to access online services with the username and password issued by your own institution.</p>
<p>In SURFconext your personal details are only provided to a service provider (such as the Donders Repository) if these details are needed to use the service.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>In my browser I cannot select any institution. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>The dialog box to select your institution can be used in most popular browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Other browsers may not be supported. Your browser must support the use of cookies and JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What if my institute is not listed in the login window?</strong></p>
<p>If your institute is not listed when you try to log in, you should contact the person who is responsible for SURFconext at your institution and ask for your institute to be allowed to access the Donders Repository. You can contact SURFconext (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;surfconext&#46;nl">support<span>&#64;</span>surfconext<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>) to find out who is responsible at your institution.

<li><p class="first"><strong>What is an ORCID-iD?</strong></p>
<p>ORCID provides you with a unique individual and persistent digital identifier that enables you to connect research contributions and to share information on large scale with other researchers. You can login to the Donders Repository using your ORCID-iD. Read how to create and ORCID-iD on the webpage (<a class="reference external" href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a>). Note that you must set your ORCID account <strong>e-mail settings</strong> such that your e-mail address is shared with at least trusted parties (such as the Donders Repository). This is required to verify your identity on the background.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What is an Onegini account?</strong>
Onegini allows you to create a digital identity that can be used to access repository. You can use Google+, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft account to login to the Donders Repository via Onegini. Read how to create an Onegini account on the Onegini webpage (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.onegini.com/">https://www.onegini.com/</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Can I have multiple user profiles in the repository?</strong>
One person can have multiple user profiles in the repository, e.g. if that person has an account at multiple universities, or if that person uses both his academic account and his social account. If you log in to the Donders Repository with different accounts, your profiles are likely to have access to different collections in different roles. Different accounts from the same user cannot be linked.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>What are the different Collection types?</strong></p>
<p>There are three collection types, one for data acquisition (Data Acquisition Collection), one for research documentation (Research Documentation Collection) and one for data sharing (Data Sharing Collection).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Data Acquisition Collection (DAC).</strong> In a Data Acquisition Collection, the research data are archived in their original form. Here, “original” means without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data. To learn more about the files that you must upload to a Data Acquisition Collection, see <a class="reference internal" href="#dacfiles"><span class="std std-ref">what to upload for DAC</span></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Research Documentation Collection (RDC).</strong> When a paper is accepted for publication, the associated RDC must document the process via which data are converted into the to-be-published results. Prior to the paper being accepted for publication, the RDC can be used as a collaboration platform via which all kinds of files are shared (analysis scripts, preliminary figures, the different versions of the paper, …). To learn more about the files that you must upload to a RDC, see this FAQ.</li>
<li><strong>Data Sharing Collection (DSC).</strong> A DSC contains the data on which the published results are based, allowing other researchers to extend scientific findings by re-analyzing data with new methods, and/or by addressing new research questions using these data. To learn more about the files that you must upload to a DSC, see <a class="reference internal" href="#organize-data-collections"><span class="std std-ref">Organize data collections</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How should I request a Data Acquisition Collection/Research Documentation Collection/ Data Sharing Collection (DAC/RDC/DSC)?</strong></p>
<p>New collections can only be requested by researchers working at or affiliated with the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior. The Donders Insitute has 4 organizational units, which all have their own management and implementation of RDM procedures: DCCN, DCC, DCN and DCMN. The way to request a collection differs per organizational unit. For details please check the Intranet of Donders Institute: <a class="reference external" href="https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/">https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What are research data?</strong></p>
<p>Research data are defined as follows:</p>
<p>All information that is (1) generated as a part of the research process and (2) on which a scientific report is/will be based.</p>
<p>This definition of research data does not only include empirical data, but also simulated data, computer scripts for analysis and simulations, stimuli presented in experiments and the computer scripts for presenting them, etc. A good way to determine what is the research data on which a study is based, is asking oneself what information has contributed to the results on which you report in your publication. And a good way to delineate the empirical from the other research data, is by asking oneself whether one has used some device for obtaining these data: empirical data are always collected using a device (a button box, a keyboard, an MRI scanner, an EEG or MEG system, a video camera, a touch screen, a microscope, …).</p>
<p>Not all studies and publications depend on research data, as defined above. This holds for theoretical, perspective and opinion papers, as well as for reviews. The Donders Repository is only relevant for those studies and publications that do depend on research data.</p>

<li><p class="first"><strong>Where should I apply for ethics approval for studies involving human participants?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the research at the Donders Institute is covered by existing ethical agreements. If you are not sure whether you need to apply, please ask your local ethics officer or your data steward. For the DCCN you can look up more details here.</p>
<p>There are 23 accredited METCs in the Netherlands that review medical/scientific research proposals that involve human subjects. The majority are linked to an institution such as an academic medical centre or a hospital. The Faculty of Social Sciences at the Radboud University has its own Ethics Committee that is referred to as &#8220;ECSW&#8221;. The Faculty of Humanities at the Radboud University has its own Ethics Committee that is referred to as &#8220;EACH&#8221;. As of recently, the Faculty of Science at the Radboud University also has its own Ethics Committee. Please contact Huub Zwarts or Frank van der Molen.</p>
<p>In case you need to apply for approval for studies that involve human participants, please ask your local ethics officer or your data steward to support you with the procedure and ask for the template informed consent forms and brochures. These include the appropriate text on how we manage and share data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Where should I apply for ethics approval for studies that involve animals?</strong></p>
<p>The Centrale Commissie Dierproeven (CCD) has approved 17 Animal Ethics Committees (Dierexperimentencommissie, DEC) in the Netherlands that review the applications for projects involving animal research. All research involving animals at the Donders Institute requires approval from the Radboud University’s Animal Experiment Committee.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How should I specify the &#8220;ethics approval identifier&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the ethics approval board, the format of the identifier is slightly different. The identifier always specifies the board that approved it, followed by the number at which it is known at that board. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CMO regio A-N 2014/288</li>
<li>ECSW 2013-0410-133</li>
<li>RUDEC 2013-180</li>
<li>IRBN 2014/005</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the local ethics board identifier, an ABR (&#8220;Algemeen Beoordeling en Registratie&#8221;) number might be assigned. The combination of these two ensures that the study is registered and can be identified both at the local as well as at the central level (i.e. at the CCMO in The Hague). Through the ABR number, the ethics application can be queried in a public database.</p>
<p>The ABR identifier is always of the form &#8220;NLxxxxx.xxx.xx&#8221;. Here are some examples of ABR identifiers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NL57538.091.16</li>
<li>NL47093.091.13</li>
<li>NL45835.091.13</li>
</ul>
<p>On www.toetsingsonline.nl you can find details on studies with an ABR number.</p>

<li><p class="first"><strong>Which files should and should I not upload to a Data Acquisition Collection (DAC)?</strong></p>
<p id="dacfiles">A DAC must contain all raw data plus a description that would allow a colleague to make sense of the .</p>
<p>By raw, we mean without any manipulations that limit future analyses of these data. In other words, raw data are original data.</p>
<p>Some examples for the different methods:</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral experiments</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>stimulus files</li>

<li>possibly eye tracker data</li>
<li>possibly video files</li>
<li>possibly ExG files</li>
<li>(if applicable) the files specified under &#8220;behavioral experiments&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>EEG experiments</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>EEG files (vhdr/vmrk/dat)</li>
<li>Presentation log files</li>
<li>possibly eye tracker data</li>
<li>possibly video and audio files that were recorded along with the EEG</li>

<li>possibly video and audio files that were recorded along with the EEG</li>
<li>(if applicable) the files specified under &#8220;behavioral experiments&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In general, you should also upload a copy of the Presentation code and stimulus material that you used during the experiment and of the lab notes that you took during the experiment. Also include a description of the experimental setup.</p>
<p>You should not upload personal information to a DAC (or any other collection). Personal information are data that directly identify your subjects (e.g., their name, address, telephone number, bank account, etc.). This also means that you should not upload the informed consent form that is signed by the subject. Note that the DAC is allowed to contain indirectly identifying information, such as detailed questionnaire results (but with the personal information removed), photos, audio and video recordings or facial features in an anatomical MRI.</p>
<p>You should not upload any data that can be obtained as the result of analyses that take raw data as input (processed data). Documenting the data analysis is a part of the Research Documentation Collection (RDC).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How should I organize the data in a Data Acquisition Collection (DAC)?</strong></p>
<p>Organize your DAC in a standard way (such as BIDS), because will make it much easier to share the data at a later point in time. Below is one example from the BIDS website. See for more examples here.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/BIDS.PNG"><img alt="_images/BIDS.PNG" src="_images/BIDS.PNG" style="width: 683.5px; height: 314.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>For all types of data we recommend that you add a &#8216;readme&#8217; document that describes the organization of the data over the files and directories.</p>
<p>For an example of a well-organized DAC from a DCCN project see here (pdf, 75 kB). The first page of this document contains the content of the &#8216;readme_general&#8217; file, including the DAC abstract.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Which files should and should I not upload to a Research Documentation Collection (RDC)?</strong></p>
<p>An RDC has three functions: documenting the scientific process, sharing preliminary results within the project team, and documenting the editorial and peer-review process.</p>
<p>In general, a RDC must contain all the information that a knowledgeable colleague needs to reproduce the results in the publication that is linked to this collection. More specifically, an RDC should contain files that document the process in which raw data are converted into results (statistical tests, summary measures, figures, tables, etc.). In a common scenario, this conversion from raw data to results is (partially or fully) specified by analysis scripts that can be executed by software packages such as MATLAB, R, Python, SPSS, Bash+FSL, etc. In this scenario, the obvious way of documenting the scientific process is by providing these analysis scripts. Also the version number of the software being use should be specified.</p>
<p>Our definition of “data” is a broad one. For instance, it also includes computer scripts, as used for analysis or modeling work. Thus, if the published results depend on computer scripts, these must be added to the RDC.</p>
<p>The RDC is a platform for sharing preliminary results (figures, tables, PowerPoint presentations, etc.) with collaborators in a project team. A RDC should contain the documents of the editorial and peer-review process pertaining to the publication that is linked to this collection (uploaded manuscripts, reviews, reply to the reviewers, …). An archived RDC must be linked to one publication.</p>
<p>Also include a description of the experimental setup.</p>
<p>Before closing the RDC, the preliminary results may be removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How to refer to the data that the researcher did not collect?</strong></p>
<p>It is possible to publish papers without having collected data yourself. For example, modeling work or using an existing data set. There are three ways to link these types of data to the new RDC.</p>
<p>If the data is already represented in the repository as one or more DAC’s, specify the DAC identification numbers in the RDC. This only works for archived DACs. A single archived DAC may be associated with multiple RDCs.</p>
<p>If the data is not represented in the repository, the researchers must either add the data to the repository, or document the data by a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI or URL). This situation applies when a DAC is not yet archived or the data was collected at another institute.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How should I organize the data in a Research Documentation Collection (RDC)?</strong></p>
<p>Data in a RDC should be organized in separate folders and sub-folders according to the type of data (e.g. raw data, scripts, peer-review process, etc.). The names of the folders should clearly indicate to the content of the folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How should I document the experimental setup?</strong></p>
<p>You must describe your experiment in a document (txt, csv, tsv, pdf, MS Word or MS Excel) that you upload to the collection. In this document, give a brief description of your experimental setup, which tasks you used and what they attend to manipulate and measure. In that document, you also explain how the conditions, stimuli and responses are represented in the presentation log files and the trigger channel of your data acquisition system. A PowerPoint presentation of the project proposal will contribute to the documentation of the experiment. Also the original presentation code (NBS Presentation, E-Prime, etc.) will contribute to the documentation. Add relevant part of this information to the appropriate collection (DAC, RDC and DSC).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Where should I store personal information about the participants?</strong></p>
<p>For data acquisition you have to know who are your participants and you need to be able to contact them. This requires personal information to be stored. The mapping of the personal information on the participant number is called the &#8220;pseudonimization key&#8221;. The pseudonimization key should be stored in an encrypted file that is stored separately from the experimental data. The file should be protected by a strong password according to the RU password policy. The password is only to be known to the PI and the researchers involved in data acquisition.</p>
<p>The pseudonimization key must never be stored in the repository.</p>

<h2>Publish data<a class="headerlink" href="#publish-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Should I always share the data of my publication?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Our funding agencies, such as NWO and EU, require this either explicitly in the grant on basis of which you carried out the work, or implicitly in their general regulations. The Radboud University has made open access part of its policy. The Donders Institute requires sharing the data.</p>
<p>There might be reasons why you do not want to share your data immediately, e.g. if you are still working on follow up publications based on the same data. In those cases you should share the data under an embargo of a certain time.</p>
<p>There might be reasons why you do not want to share your data with everyone, e.g. if it represents financial value. In those cases you should make a custom data use agreement under which the data is to be shared (which might e.g. contain a clause about paying for the data).</p>
<p>There might be reasons related to the privacy of your subjects and where the data cannot be de-identified. In that case you still might be able to share processed results at the group level that allow other researchers to validate the claims in your paper. Note that unprocessed imaging and MEG/EEG data can be shared after it has been de-identified and under the appropriate data use agreement.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Can I share my data if they belong to an ongoing project?</strong></p>
<p>When a research project is still ongoing (i.e. the Data Acquisition Collection is still open), and the researchers want to write a paper using the data collected until present, then they can create a Data Sharing Collection (DSC) in which the data that were used in the publication are shared. You should document in the DSC that these shared data are part of a larger project, of which only a part is shared in the current DSC.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What data should I share in a Data Sharing Collection (DSC)?</strong></p>
<p>You should share all data that is of potential value to other researchers: the DSC should contain the relevant information (1) to reproduce the published results, and (2) to extend on these published results.</p>
<p>However, you should only share data that has been de-identified and that cannot be traced back to the individual. Keep in mind that, in all cases, sharing human data requires that the participants have signed an informed consent form that allows the data to be shared.</p>
<p>Raw photos, videos or audio files should not be shared in a DSC.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How should I organize the data in the repository (DAC/RDC/DSC)?</strong></p>
<p>Organize your collections in a standard way (such as BIDS), because will make it much easier to share the data at a later point in time. Below is one example from the BIDS website. See more examples here.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/BIDS.PNG"><img alt="_images/BIDS.PNG" src="_images/BIDS.PNG" style="width: 683.5px; height: 314.0px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>For all types of data we recommend that you add a text document (txt, pdf or Microsoft Word) that describes the organization of the data over the files and directories.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What is a Data Use Agreement (DUA)?</strong></p>
<p>The DUA specifies the conditions under which data in a DSC is shared, e.g. to give attribution. The DUA may also include details on specific limitations on the reuse of the data. As manager or contributor to the DSC you specify under which DUA the data is to be shared. When the external researcher agrees with the collection’s DUA, he/she will be automatically added as a viewer to it, which gives him/her read access.</p>
<p>The repository provides two default DUAs: for collections that include potentially identifiable data from individual human subjects, please use RU-DI-HD-1.0; for collections that only include data that cannot be identified in any way (e.g. only group results, or data that does not originate from human subjects), please use RU-DI-NH-1.0. We also support several others DUAs for other types of data. If a dataset has more specific requirements for data sharing (e.g. due to sensitivity of data or requirements of funders or collaborating partners), it is required to make a custom DUA. See here a list of aspects to consider in the design of a DUA. For further help, please send an email to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:datasupport&#37;&#52;&#48;donders&#46;ru&#46;nl">datasupport<span>&#64;</span>donders<span>&#46;</span>ru<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What is a persistent identifier?</strong></p>
<p>A persistent identifier is a long-lasting reference to an online document or file. The Donders Repository persistent identifiers are realized by the handle system. See more on the Wikipedia page: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Can I use the persistent identifiers generated by the Donders Repository for my publication?</strong></p>
<p>As a prerequisite for publication, several journals now request a persistent identifier of the shared data, which they publish in the footnote of the article. Researchers from the Donders Institute can use the persistent identifier of the published Data Sharing Collection (DSC) for that purpose.</p>
<p>A published DSC&#8217;s persistent identifier has the same status as the persistent identifiers that are typically used to refer to published journal articles, such as the digital object identifiers (DOIs). A persistent identifier allows for direct access to a digital object, even if its URL has changed.</p>
<p>When sending the DSC&#8217;s persistent identifier to the journal, in the email, you should add some additional information pertaining to the conditions under which the shared data can be accessed. Here is a template email that you can use for that purpose:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&#8220;The shared data for paper XXX-YYY can be found via the following persistent identifier: <a class="reference external" href="http://hdl.handle.net/MyPersistentID">http://hdl.handle.net/MyPersistentID</a> (replace MyPersistentID by the string that you copy and paste from the collection details page).</li>
<li>Prior to accessing and downloading the shared data, users must create an account. It is possible to use an institutional account, an ORCID account, or a social ID from Google+, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Microsoft. After authentication, users must accept the Data Use Agreement (DUA), after which they are automatically authorised to download the shared data. The DUA specifies whether there are any restrictions on how the data may be used.</li>
<li>As an example of how to access shared data, one may follow the Digital Object Indentifier (doi) in the data availability segment of the footnote of <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154881">this paper</a>. Instructions for how to request access and to download shared data can be found at <a class="reference internal" href="user-manual/access-shared-data.html#access-shared-data"><span class="std std-ref">Access shared data</span></a>.</li>
<li>The Radboud University and the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour will keep these shared data available for at least 10 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Can I share my data without the need for the downloading user to register an account?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, this is not possible. The reason is that most DSCs have restrictions on the  reuse of the data, e.g. the requirement to cite Radboud University as the source of the data and to protect the identity of human participants. Agreeing with a DUA is only possible for registered users.</p>
<p>Journals usually accept that data sets are shared only after registering / access request, if data sets include potentially identifiable human data (e.g. MRI). In this case, you should explain to the journal why access request, and logging in to the repository, is required to access the data. Here&#8217;s a template paragraph that you can use for this purpose:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>All data was acquired in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, following informed consent of participants and in line with the requirements of the Ethics Committee. In line with requirements of the Ethics Committee and the Radboud University security officer, potentially identifying data (such as imaging data) can only be shared to identifable researchers, hence the requirement for registration and for requesting access. Neither authors nor data steward is involved in granting access to external researchers, this is only based on the complete registration of the researcher and follows a “click-through” procedure.

<p>If a &#8216;published&#8217; DSC contains incorrect and/or insufficient information, a collection manager may ask the research administrator to make it &#8216;editable&#8217; again, allowing for changes to be made. If this DSC is modified and thereafter changed to &#8216;published&#8217; again, then a second read-only copy is generated, with another unique persistent identifier.</p>
<p>Since the original collection is persistent, it will remain accessible as well. Therefore, carefully check all the files before changing a DSC to &#8216;published&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How many publications can be linked to a Data Sharing Collection (DSC)?</strong></p>
<p>A DSC can be linked to zero, one or multiple publications. The first situation (no publication) occurs when a data set is considered useful for external researchers in their future studies. The second situation (one publication) typically occurs when a data set is used in a publication, and the DSC is shared around the same time that the paper becomes available on the publisher’s website. The third situation (more publications) typically occurs when a DSC gets reused in other publications following the paper that was published together with DSC.</p>

<li><p class="first"><strong>How do I share data with external reviewers?</strong></p>
<p>The Donders Repository includes the possibility of sharing data from a Data Sharing Collection with external reviewers (i.e. before publication) in a way that protects the anonymity of the reviewers. For details on this see the manual on data sharing.</p>

<h2>Access shared data<a class="headerlink" href="#access-shared-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Why do I need to login / create an account to download published data?</strong></p>
<p>The majority of data sets shared through the Donders Repository include data collected in human subjects. If the data is potentially identifiable - e.g. MRI data - these data are shared with restrictions to ensure the privacy of research participants. In line with privacy legislation, the Radboud University (security officer) and local ethical committee require that users of these data publications can be identified (e.g. in case of violation of a Data Use Agreement). Therefore, authentication in the Donders Repository is required to download these data sets.</p>
<p>Downloading completely anonymized datasets and non-human / non-sensitive datasets published under an OpenDataCommons or CreativeCommons license, preferably does not require authentication. Developments to allow anonymous access to these data publications are currently ongoing. (Expected release: January 2019).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>I logged in with my ORCID-iD but it appears I have not the right permissions to download data, what should I do?</strong></p>
<p>The Donders Repository needs to be able to verify your identity based on the e-mail address that is shared with your ORCID-iD. Therefore, you must allow (at least) trusted parties to be able to see your e-mail address. Please go to <a class="reference external" href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a>, click on your e-mail address settings and change the visibility settings to (at least) trusted parties as below.</p>
