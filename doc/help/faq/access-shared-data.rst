Access shared data
==================

.. _faq-create-account-download-data:

1.  **Do I need to login / create an account to download published data?**

    That depends on the type of data that you would like to access.
    
    A large fraction of the data sets shared through the ${repositoryDescription} include data from human research participants. If this data is potentially identifiable - e.g. MRI data - these data are shared with restrictions to ensure the privacy of research participants. In line with privacy legislation, the Radboud University security officer and local ethical committee require that users of these data publications can be identified (e.g. in case of violation of a Data Use Agreement). Therefore, potentially identifiable data are shared under a specific Data Use Agreement that requires authentication in the ${repositoryDescription} to download these data sets.
    
    Restricted access datasets are accessible at https://webdav.data-acc.ru.nl for authenticated users that have been granted acces to the data.

    Downloading anonymized datasets and non-human / non-identifiable datasets, which are published under a `Creative Commons <https://creativecommons.org>`_ or an `Open Data Commons <https://www.opendatacommons.org>`_ license or under a copyright agreement that does not impose restrictions on the access and redistribution, does not require authentication.

    Public datasets are accessible at https://public.data-acc.ru.nl without authentication.

.. _faq-orcid-permissions:

2.  **I logged in with my ORCID-iD but it appears I have not the right permissions to download data, what should I do?**

    The ${repositoryDescription} needs to be able to verify your identity based on the e-mail address that is shared with your ORCID-iD. Therefore, you must allow (at least) trusted parties to be able to see your e-mail address. Please go to https://orcid.org, click on your e-mail address settings and change the visibility settings to (at least) trusted parties as below.
