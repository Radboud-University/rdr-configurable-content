Access shared data
------------------

1.  **Why do I need to login / create an account to download published data?**

    The majority of data sets shared through the Donders Repository include data collected in human subjects. If the data is potentially identifiable - e.g. MRI data - these data are shared with restrictions to ensure the privacy of research participants. In line with privacy legislation, the Radboud University (security officer) and local ethical committee require that users of these data publications can be identified (e.g. in case of violation of a Data Use Agreement). Therefore, authentication in the Donders Repository is required to download these data sets.

    Downloading completely anonymized datasets and non-human / non-sensitive datasets published under an OpenDataCommons or CreativeCommons license, preferably does not require authentication. Developments to allow anonymous access to these data publications are currently ongoing. (Expected release: January 2019).

2.  **I logged in with my ORCID-iD but it appears I have not the right permissions to download data, what should I do?**

    The Donders Repository needs to be able to verify your identity based on the e-mail address that is shared with your ORCID-iD. Therefore, you must allow (at least) trusted parties to be able to see your e-mail address. Please go to https://orcid.org/, click on your e-mail address settings and change the visibility settings to (at least) trusted parties as below.
