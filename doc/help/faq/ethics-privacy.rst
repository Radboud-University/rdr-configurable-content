1.  **Where should I apply for ethics approval for studies involving human participants?**

    A lot of the research at the Donders Institute is covered by existing ethical agreements. If you are not sure whether you need to apply, please ask your local ethics officer or your data steward.

    There are 23 accredited METCs in the Netherlands that review medical/scientific research proposals that involve human subjects. The majority are linked to an institution such as an academic medical centre or a hospital. The Faculty of Social Sciences at the Radboud University has its own Ethics Committee that is referred to as `ECSS<https://www.ru.nl/socialsciences/research/ethics-committee-social-science-ecss/>`_. The Faculty of Arts at the Radboud University has its own Ethics Committee that is referred to as `EACH<https://www.ru.nl/eac-humanities/>`_. The Faculty of Science at the Radboud University has its own Ethics Committee that is referred to as `REC<https://www.ru.nl/science/research/about-our-research/ethics-committee/>`_. For the DCCN you can find more details `here<https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=cmo-ethics>`_.

    In case you need to apply for approval for studies that involve human participants, please ask your local ethics officer or your data steward to support you with the procedure and ask for the template informed consent forms and brochures. These include the appropriate text on how we manage and share data.

2.  **Where should I apply for ethics approval for studies that involve animals?**

    The Centrale Commissie Dierproeven (CCD) has approved 17 Animal Ethics Committees (Dierexperimentencommissie, DEC) in the Netherlands that review the applications for projects involving animal research. All research involving animals at the Donders Institute requires approval from the Radboud University's Animal Experiment Committee.

.. _faq-ethical-approval-identifier:

3.  **How should I specify the "ethics approval identifier"?**

    Depending on the ethics approval board, the format of the identifier is slightly different. The identifier always specifies the board that approved it, followed by the number at which it is known at that board. Here are some examples:

    - CMO regio A-N 2014/288

    - ECSW 2013-0410-133

    - RUDEC 2013-180

    - IRBN 2014/005

    Besides the local ethics board identifier, an ABR ("Algemeen Beoordeling en Registratie") number might be assigned. The combination of these two ensures that the study is registered and can be identified both at the local as well as at the central level (i.e. at the CCMO in The Hague). Through the ABR number, the ethics application can be queried in a public database.

    The ABR identifier is always of the form "NLxxxxx.xxx.xx". Here are some examples of ABR identifiers:

    - NL57538.091.16
    - NL47093.091.13
    - NL45835.091.13

    On https://www.toetsingonline.nl/ you can find details on studies with an ABR number.
