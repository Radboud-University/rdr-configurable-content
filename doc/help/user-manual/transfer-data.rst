Transfer data
=============

To transfer data, you should use a HTTP-based file transfer called `WebDAV <https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV>`_. To use this, you need a username and password.

*Radboud University or RadboudUMC employees can use the credentials provided by their employer (u-, s-, e- or z-number and its password) to use WebDAV file transfer.
If you have no Radboud University of RadboudUMC employee account, first create an account by following the steps on* :ref:`this page <data-access-account>` *before continuing.*

|warning| *This is not the preferred option for Windows as it can cause several issues. We suggest either using YodaDrive or Cyberduck.*

Best practice is to not work directly on a network drive, but to store your files there whenever youâ€™re done. When you would work directly on a network drive, each update results in a file transfer to a remote system which does involve some latency. Moreover, some tools create files that should not be stored, but that would be transferred anyway. For instance, MAC creates a .DS_Store file, and Word creates ~$temp.docx.

After up- or downloading your files, make sure the transfer was completed accurately.
