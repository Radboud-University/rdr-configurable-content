YodaDrive
=========

YodaDrive is an easy way to integrate your RDR collections in your windows file explorer. It is a WebDAV client for Windows, allowing the user to mount a remote WebDAV server as a local drive.

YodaDrive is recommended over :ref:`mounting a network drive <mount-network-drive>` directly using Windows, because it solves the problems with directories with too many files, files that are too large and in general itâ€™s more stable.

Install YodaDrive
-----------------

1. Download and install YodaDrive from https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/YodaDrive/releases/download/0.2.6.2/YodaDrive-0.2.6.2.zip. You need administrator privileges to complete the installation procedure. If you work on a PC or laptop managed by the RU, please contact the ICT helpdesk to gain temporary administrator privileges.

2. After installation open YodaDrive by clicking on the system tray icon
