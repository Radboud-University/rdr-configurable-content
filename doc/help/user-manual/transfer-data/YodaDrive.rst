YodaDrive
=========

YodaDrive is a WebDAV client for Windows, allowing the user to mount a remote WebDAV server as a local drive.

YodaDrive is recommended over :ref:`mounting a network drive <mount-network-drive>` directly using Windows, because it solves the problems with directories with too many files, files that are too large and in general itâ€™s more stable.
