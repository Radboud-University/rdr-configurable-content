The Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour is a world-class research centre devoted to understanding the
mechanistic underpinnings of human cognition and behavior in health and disease. The Institute is home to more than 600
researchers from 35 countries who share the common goal of contributing to the advancement of the brain-, cognitive- and
behavioral sciences through investigator-driven research, and improving health, education and technology by applying
advances in this field. The Institute&rsquo;s mission includes conducting interdisciplinary research of excellence at the
unique interface between genetic, molecular and cellular processes at one end and computational, system-level
neuroscience with cognitive and behavioral analysis at the other end.
