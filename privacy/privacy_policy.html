<h1>DI RDM Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This privacy policy describes how the Donders Institute (DI) Research Data Management (RDM) repository (in the following, called the service) processes and stores data about its users.</p>
<p>The service is provided by the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour (Kapittelweg 29, 6525 EN Nijmegen, The Netherlands), which belongs to the Radboud University.</p>
<p>The service has the following objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data preservation for reuse within the DI</li>
<li>Documentation of the research process to support the reproducibility of published results</li>
<li>Data sharing with the scientific community outside the DI</li>
</ol>
<p>The service processes and stores two types of data about its users: (a) information obtained from the user's identity provider (IdP) and (b) information pertaining to the user's interaction with the service.</p>
<p>The following data are obtained from your IdP upon login:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your name (given name and surname)</li>
<li>The name of the home organization of your IdP</li>
<li>The personal identifier assigned to you by your IdP</li>
<li>The email address assigned to you by your IdP </li>
</ol>
<p>The following data are obtained from your interaction with the service:</p>
<ol>
<li>The your roles in the system that allow you to access collections,  and when changes in roles were made</li>
<li>The modifications that you make to a collection's files and/or attributes</li>
<li>The your access to collection's files and/or attributes</li>
</ol>
<p>The personal data stored by the service is not accessible to other users of the service, unless this is required for the objectives of the service. Your contributions to collections are visible to the managers and other contributors of that collection. Your contributions to a data sharing collection as an author are treated as a publication and are publicly visible.</p>
<p>The personal data stored by the service are not shared with other services, unless required for the objectives of the service.</p>
<p>Personal data are stored for as long as is required for the objectives of the service. If collections are deleted, then also the personal data associated with those collections are deleted.</p>
